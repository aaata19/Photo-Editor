This application allows users to upload and edit photos (raster images in JPEG, PNG formats, etc.).
Features

Image Upload and Save
Users can upload images via drag and drop or using a file input control. The final edited image can be saved.

Selection Mechanism
Initially, the entire image is selected. Users can modify the selection area using mouse down and mouse up actions, similar to the selection mechanism in Microsoft Paint.

Interactive Cropping
Users can select an area of the image with the mouse for cropping.

Image Scaling
The image can be scaled while maintaining aspect ratio. Users provide either the new width or the new height.

Add Text to Image
Users can add text to the image. The text properties include the content, size, color, and position.

Move Selection
Users can move the selection using the mouse and the Shift key.

Delete Selection
Deleting a selection turns the pixels in that area white.
